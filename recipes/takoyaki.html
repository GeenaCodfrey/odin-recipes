            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Takoyaki is a popular street food from Japan. It has since become famous in different countries.</p>
            <p>Typically, it is made of wheat flour, eggs, and dashi with diced octopus, tempura scraps, and green
                onion.
                The mixture is then cooked in a special takoyaki pan, which is designed to make the snack in the shape
                of
                small round balls.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients and tool</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups of flour</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup of dashi (Japanese fish stock) or water</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of diced octopus</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of tempura scraps</li>
                <li>2 green onions, finely chopped</li>
                <li>Takoyaki sauce, mayonnaise and aonori (dried seaweed flakes) and katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)
                    for
                    topping</li>
                <li>Takoyaki pan</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, eggs, and dashi or water to make the batter. Mix until smooth.
                </li>
                <li>Add the diced octopus, tempura scraps, and green onions to the batter and mix well.</li>
                <li>Heat the takoyaki pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, brush the cups with some oil.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the cups, filling them about 3/4 full.</li>
                <li>Use a skewer or the end of a chopstick to poke a small hole in the center of each ball.</li>
                <li>Once the edges start to firm up, use the skewers or chopsticks to flip the balls over in the pan.
                </li>
                <li>Continue cooking until the balls are golden brown and cooked through.</li>

                <li>Brush with takoyaki sauce and mayonnaise, and then top with aonori and katsuobushi.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
