    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Coto Makassar is a traditional Indonesian soup dish that originated in the city of Makassar in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Coto Makassar is considered a traditional local dish and is typically found in street vendors, warungs, and in some restaurants that specialized in Makassar cuisine.</p>
    <p>The dish is made with a broth that is seasoned with a combination of spices, such as garlic, shallot, ginger, and chili, which give it a rich and flavorful taste. It is typically made with beef or buffalo meat, but some variations use chicken or pork. The meat is cooked until tender in the broth and then served with a variety of toppings such as shredded cabbage, bean sprouts, and scallions. The dish is usually served with rice and sometimes also with lontong (compressed rice cake) or ketupat (boiled rice dumpling) on the side.</p>
